# What i need to do to run this code?

## package requirements:
It seems you only need to install croniter: ```pip install croniter``` will do it.

## configuration:

1. create config.py, a sample is given in config-examples.py
2. create config/subscriber.xml, a sample is also given in /config/subscriber_example.xml

## run this code.
```python main.py```

If everything goes okay, you will see a shell interface, type help for more information.

# PS
I am really really a bad coder and not good at writing document and comments. If you have anything in trouble, feel free to open a issue and i will try my best to fix the problem.

The code is pushed in a hurry, i will add a document to explain this code when i have free time.
